It means guessing the name of the person who has written a piece of text.\r\nIn a world where anonymity is being used for all the wrong reasons Authorship Attribution can help to remove the veil from  \r\nthe hidden faces of forgers, criminals, terrorists and sometimes gifted humble writers who do not want publicity. The idea of finding writer of a document is quite simple. Every writer develops a unique style of writing over the years.This style stays unchanged from one book to the other and can give away the author's name . \r\n\r\n### Is it something new?\r\nNopes, far from it. A guy called Lorenzo Valla used manual laborious Authorship Attribution process in 15th century to prove the forgery of the Donation of Constantine  by comparing the Latin used in the document to the Latin used in 4th Century written texts.\r\n\r\n### What has changed since 1439AD? \r\nA lot.if we skip the history of change and get right to the current state, Big Data and Machine Learning when combined have unleashed a whole arsenal of tools to be used for Authorship Attribution. With the help of distributed clusters of computers munching and crunching petabytes worth of data in parallel, one can literally find a needle in the haystack.\r\n\r\n### What have I done in this project?\r\nIn this project I have used Apache Spark and a bunch of other python libraries such as scikit learn, numpy, nltk, pandas, gutenberg and boto to crunch all the books available in English language on project Gutenberg site (http://gutenberg.org).\r\nAfter crunching these books, I took a sample and used that sample to train different machine learning algorithms such as  K Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machine , Random Forest and Multinomial Naive Bayes.\r\n\r\n### Result?\r\nThe end result was a model with more than 90% prediction accuracy for authors used in the study.\r\n\r\n[Watch Brief Introductory Video](https://youtu.be/h67zUVyB7yY)  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
